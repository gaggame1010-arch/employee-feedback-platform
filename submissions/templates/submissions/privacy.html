<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p class="muted">Last updated: {{ "now"|date:"F j, Y" }}</p>

<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This Anonymous Employee Platform ("Platform") is designed to provide a secure and anonymous channel 
  for employees to submit concerns, issues, questions, and suggestions to Human Resources. Your privacy 
  and anonymity are our top priorities.
</p>

<h2>2. Anonymity Guarantee</h2>
<p>
  <strong>We do not collect, store, or track any information that could identify you personally.</strong>
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>No IP Address Logging:</strong> We do not log or store your IP address when you submit a report.</li>
  <li><strong>No Browser Fingerprinting:</strong> We do not use cookies, tracking pixels, or any technology that could identify your device.</li>
  <li><strong>No Account Required:</strong> You do not need to create an account or provide any personal information to use this platform.</li>
  <li><strong>No Email Collection:</strong> We do not ask for or store your email address.</li>
  <li><strong>No Name Collection:</strong> We do not ask for or store your name or any identifying information.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  The only information we collect is what you voluntarily provide in your submission: the type of submission 
  (issue, concern, question, or suggestion), title, and description. Even this information is stored without 
  any connection to your identity.
</p>

<h2>3. What Information We Collect</h2>
<p>We collect only the following information:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Submission Content:</strong> The type, title, and description you provide in your submission.</li>
  <li><strong>Receipt Code:</strong> A randomly generated 10-digit code that allows you to check the status of your submission.</li>
  <li><strong>Timestamp:</strong> The date and time your submission was created (for tracking purposes only).</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>We do NOT collect:</strong> Your name, email address, employee ID, department, location, IP address, 
  browser information, device information, or any other identifying data.
</p>

<h2>4. Data Ownership</h2>
<p>
  <strong>You own your data.</strong> Your submissions belong to you. However, by using this platform, you grant 
  the company permission to:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Store your submission securely in our database</li>
  <li>Allow authorized HR personnel to view and respond to your submission</li>
  <li>Use aggregated, anonymized data for internal reporting and improvement purposes</li>
</ul>

<p>
  You cannot edit or delete your submission after it has been submitted. This is by design to maintain 
  the integrity of the reporting process and prevent tampering.
</p>

<h2>5. Who Can See What</h2>

<h3>5.1. Your Submission</h3>
<p>
  <strong>Only authorized HR personnel</strong> with staff-level access to the HR Dashboard can view your submission. 
  This includes:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The submission type (Issue, Concern, Question, or Suggestion)</li>
  <li>The title and description you provided</li>
  <li>The receipt code</li>
  <li>The date and time of submission</li>
  <li>Any HR responses to your submission</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.2. HR Responses</h3>
<p>
  When HR responds to your submission, their response is linked to your submission and can be viewed by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>You (using your receipt code)</li>
  <li>Authorized HR personnel</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.3. Who Cannot See Your Submission</h3>
<p>
  The following people <strong>cannot</strong> access your submission:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your manager or supervisor (unless they are also authorized HR personnel)</li>
  <li>Other employees</li>
  <li>IT administrators (they have no access to submission content)</li>
  <li>External parties</li>
</ul>

<h3>5.4. Status Lookup</h3>
<p>
  You can check the status of your submission using your receipt code. This lookup shows:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Your submission details</li>
  <li>Current status (New, In Review, Responded, or Closed)</li>
  <li>Any HR responses</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <strong>No one else can access your submission</strong> without your receipt code. Keep your receipt code 
  secure and do not share it with others unless you want them to see your submission.
</p>

<h2>6. Data Security</h2>
<p>
  We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>HTTPS Encryption:</strong> All data transmitted between your browser and our servers is encrypted using HTTPS (TLS 1.2+).</li>
  <li><strong>Secure Database:</strong> Submissions are stored in an encrypted database with restricted access.</li>
  <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Only authorized HR personnel with secure authentication can access the HR Dashboard.</li>
  <li><strong>Rate Limiting:</strong> We limit the number of submissions per IP address to prevent abuse.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
<p>
  Submissions are retained indefinitely to maintain a record of employee concerns and HR responses. 
  This allows HR to track patterns, ensure follow-up, and maintain accountability.
</p>

<h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
<p>You have the right to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Submit anonymous reports without fear of retaliation</li>
  <li>Check the status of your submission using your receipt code</li>
  <li>Receive responses from HR (if they choose to respond)</li>
  <li>Request information about how your data is handled (contact HR)</li>
</ul>

<p>
  <strong>Note:</strong> Because submissions are anonymous, we cannot verify your identity to fulfill 
  requests to delete or modify your submission. This is by design to protect your anonymity.
</p>

<h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The "Last updated" date at the top of this page 
  indicates when changes were made. Continued use of the platform after changes constitutes acceptance 
  of the updated policy.

  Human Resources department.
